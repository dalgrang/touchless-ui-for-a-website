# Touchless User Interface for a Website
Interact with a website using the point/area pointers that are controlled by the position of the face and the facial expressions.

This project is for my bachelor's thesis, [Prototyping Touchless User Interface for Interacting with a Website](https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/266107).
